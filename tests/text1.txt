Sometimes I'm unbalanced and I think, "Rah, why am I losin' my steps?"
Lately, I'm paranoid, I feel my life is a mess
I'm just usin' my voice, hope it will have an effect
He was just once a boy, often I seem to forget
Lookin' at Polaroids of pictures secretly kept
You know what was destroyed, but you don't know what was left
Tryna phase out the noise of who you hear in your head
Everything is a choice and anything can be said
Is you missin' the point? Are you just hearin' me vent?
Or is you in understandin', knowin' my words will connect?
I keep you in my prayers 'cause life is short as we know
Every mistake you make should contribute to your growth
What you choose to avoid'll probably come in your dreams
I'm not forgivin' for you, man, I'm forgivin' for me
And sometimes
